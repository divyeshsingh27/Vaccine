            <p class="covi1 sectionSubTag">The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, codenamed AZD1222, and sold under
                the
                brand names Covishield and Vaxzevria among others, is a viral vector vaccine for prevention
                of COVID-19. Developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Studies carried out in 2020 showed that the
                efficacy of the vaccine is 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19{having some symptoms of Covid 19}
                after first dose and 81.3% after the second dose. It is 61% effective against Delta Variant. The vaccine
                has a good safety profile, with side effects including injection-site pain, headache, and nausea, all
                generally resolving within a few days; severe side effect is extremely rare. It is a WHO approved
                vaccine. The criteria for coviShield is that your age should be above 18. </p>

            <p class="approval otherNation">Approval of CoviShield</p>
            <p class="covi2 info">The first country to issue a temporary or emergency approval for the
                Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was the UK. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
                began a review of efficacy and safety data on 27 November 2020, followed by approval for use on 30
                December 2020, becoming the second vaccine approved for use in the national vaccination programme.The
                BBC reported that the first person to receive the vaccine outside of clinical trials was vaccinated on 4
                January 2021.</p>
            <p class="covi3 info">The European Medicines Agency (EMA) began review of the vaccine on 12 January 2021, and
                stated in a press release that a recommendation could be issued by the agency by 29 January, followed by
                the European Commission deciding on a conditional marketing authorisation within days. On 29 January
                2021, the EMA recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for AZD1222 for people 18 years
                of age and older, and the recommendation was accepted by the European Commission the same day. Prior to
                approval across the EU, the Hungarian regulator unilaterally approved the vaccine instead of waiting for
                EMA approval.</p>

            <p class="covi5 covi4">On 30 January 2021, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health approved the AstraZeneca vaccine
                for use, becoming the first vaccine to be approved in Vietnam. The vaccine has since been approved by a
                number of non-EU countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, El
                Salvador, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan regulatory
                authorities for emergency usage in their respective countries.</p>
            <p class="covi6">South Korea approved the vaccine on 10 February 2021, thus becoming the first vaccine to be approved for use in that country. The
                regulator recommended the two-shot regimen be used in all adults, including the elderly, noting that
                consideration is needed when administering the vaccine to individuals over 65 years of age due to
                limited data from that demographic in clinical trials. On the same day, the World Health Organization
                (WHO) issued interim guidance and recommended the AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults, its Strategic
                Advisory Group of Experts also having considered use where variants were present and concluded there was
                no need not to recommend it. Later in February, the government and regulatory authorities in Australia
                (16 February 2021) and Canada
                (26 February 2021) granted approval for temporary use of the vaccine.</p>
