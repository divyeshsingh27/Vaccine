            <p class="sectionSubTag">Covaxin (codenamed as BBV152) is an inactivated virus-based COVID-19
                vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. In
                July 2021, Bharat Biotech reported the vaccine to be 64% effective against asymptomatic cases{when you
                have already recovered from CoronaVirus}, 78% effective against symptomatic cases{when you have some
                symptoms of CoronaVirus}, 93% effective against severe COVID-19 infection, and 65% effective against the
                Delta variant.It is only available for age group above 18.</p>

            <p class="man">Manufacturing the Vaccine</p>
            <p class="manufactureTag">A sample of CoronaVirus was isolated by India's National Institute of Virology and
                used to grow large quantities of the virus using vero cells{obtianed from kidney epithelial extracted
                from African Green Monkey}. From then on, the viruses are soaked in beta-propiolactone, which
                deactivates them by binding to their genes, while leaving other viral particles intact. The resulting
                inactivated viruses are then mixed with the aluminium-based adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II{increases
                effieciency of CoronaVaccine}. This was how Covaccine was developed.</p>
<hr>
            <p class="otherNation">CoVaccine in other nations</p>
            <p class="info">The vaccine was approved for emergency use in Iran and Zimbabwe. Nepal granted EUA{Emergency
                Use Authorization} for
                Covaxin on 19 March 2021. On 7 April, Mexico gave emergency authorization for Covaxin. On 19 April 2021,
                Philippines granted EUA{Emergency
                Use Authorization} to Covaxin.</p>
            <p class="info">On 31 March, the Brazilian health regulator Anvisa rejected Bharat Biotech's application for
                supplying Covaxin in the country due to non-compliance with manufacturing process. Bharat Biotech stated
                that they would re-apply after meeting the requirements.On June 4, Anvisa approved exceptional
                imports of Covaxin, imposing conditions that restrict it mainly to healthy adults and limiting it to
                just 1% of the country's population to manage the risks through control and supervision of side effects.
